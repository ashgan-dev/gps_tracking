# gps_tracking
multi GPS tracking demo with flask and leaflet.js

This demo use flask to feed leaflet.js and leaflet-realtime from geojson data stored in .txt files.

this was uploaded from another project I can't share. so, I clean files a bit, remove unnecessary parts or sensible details, and put it here.

I provide a few data files in upload folder, so you can play with it.

all you really need is the leaflet script in itself and a geojson source to point at.
